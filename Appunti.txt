Creazione sito in GitHub (VA AGGIORNATO)
Si sfruttano le GitHub pages:
- dal sito GitHub, nella pagina del repository click su (ingranaggio) Settings
  - scorrere in basso fino a GitHub Pages e creare le pagine accettando i default;
    GitHub crea un sito con url https://alec58.github.io/Coursera-test/
	e mette i file relativi nel branch "gh-pages" del repository.
	In GitHub Desktop ho reso attivo il branch gh-pages (serve?)
  - nella dir radice (locale) del repository creare una dir (es. "Site") e in
    questa dir creare index.html: il file si vedrà in Internet
	all'url https://alec58.github.io/Coursera-test/site/
	... e in "site" si può fare il resto del sito
	
browser-sync
Serve per evitare di dover ricaricare manualmente le pagine sul browser
dopo le modifiche.
Da cmd portarsi sulla dir del sito (C:\Users\acazz\Documents\GitHub\Coursera-test\site) e dare il comando
browser-sync start --server --directory --files "*"

Da adesso in poi, non appena si salvano le modifiche ai file di questa
dir (e sottodir), nel browser le si vedranno automaticamente, senza
dover ricaricare la pagina.

#01 What is HTML?
HyperText: hypertext is text which contains links to other texts
Markup: markup means to mark something up, to annotate allo scopo di dare informazioni sul contenuto che viene marcato
Language: HTML usa un linguaggio formato da marcatori ("tags") che racchiudono informazioni indicandone il tipo (es. titolo, paragrafo di testo, immagine ...)
HTML is human readable. So these tags look like instructions for a document structure.
language basically implies
that it has its own syntax meaning there's a right and a wrong way to code it. 
Html also has it's own semantics which means tag
names can mean something either to machines or to humans
HTML provides the structure which means what components
does the HTML document have
Note that that does not tell you anything about how these components are visually
laid out, what they look like, what color they are, what font size they are.
It only tells you what are the components
The color and style is the role of CSS.
So colors, layouts, font style,
font sizes, in other words any stylistic types of things
avaScript, it's job is to provide behavior, provide functionality

Anatomy of an HTML Tag
Tag, attributi

Basic HTML Document Structure
doctype (usarlo SEMPRE): quirk mode e standard mode
html/head(metadata): charset title/body(contenuto)
i tag devono essere correttamente nidificati
il browser interpreta il codice html sequenzialmente, dall'inizio verso la fine del file.

05 HTML Content Models
The term content model refers to the full behavior the browser
applies to the elements belonging to that content model,
and to the nesting rules of those elements: in other words, which elements are allowed to be nested inside which other elements
Prior to HTML5 specification, HTML elements were either block level or
inline elements.
HTML5 split these two content models into seven models
block-level o inline element
Block level elements render to begin on the new line by default
Block-level elements are allowed to contain inline or
other block-level elements within them.
This is in contrast to inline elements, which render on the same line by default
Inline elements also have a restriction that they can only
contain other in line elements.
In other words, an inline element cannot have as part of its content a block level element.
Block-level elements roughly translate into the new HTML5 category of flow content, and inline elements roughly translate into the HTML5 category of phrasing content. 
Elementi generici: div e span
The div element is your most generic block-level element, and
the span is your super generic, inline element. 
the new line characters (nel codice!) that follow the div tags
make absolutely no difference to the html page and how it renders
1 o più spazi = 1 spazio

06 Heading Elements (and some new HTML5 semantic comments)
what does semantic html element mean?
Well, a semantic html element is an element that implies some
meaning to the content.
In other words, it's an element that tells you something about the content,
whether its importance, whether it's a little bit of its description,
it basically hints to you to that meaning.
Now the reason that's important is because us, humans, and
machines can understand the meaning of that content surrounded by a semantic
tag much better than if we just surround it with some tag that doesn't really
tell us anything other than this is some sort of a division within the document
First, even though their (dei tag h) default rendering in the browser appears to give them
visual distinction, these should not be used for styling.
These elements are only meant to convey structure of your HTML page, nothing more
and specifically the h1 tag,
that it is of utmost importance to use it and that it should contain the wording,
which truly conveys the central topic of the rest of the content
New HTML5 semantic tags:
the header tag basically contains some header information about the page.
So usually, it consists of company logo, some tagline, sometimes, navigation.
Actually, often, navigation is contained within the header as well
The nav tag signifies some content that is used for navigation within our website
we have our familiar h1 tag and
you should absolutely always have that. 
section / article
An aside tag is basically an element that communicates that there's something
that is inside of this element that is related to the main content of the page,
but not as direct a relationship as the main content.
And finally, we have the footer tag, which, just like it sounds,
has the footer information in it.
Now, the thing to note about all of these tags is they're all block level elements
So as far as we're concerned,
visually we might as well have just used the div tags everywhere.
However, if you look at the code, it is obvious how much easier it is to read and
understand what's going on structurally in this HTML page
That's the power of the semantic elements.
They inherently convey some meaning

07 Lists
lists are an incredibly useful HTML structure that allows you to
group related content. 
it's totally natural that lists appeal to us as an organization tool
ul / ol /like; sublist (livelli)

08 HTML Character Entity References
Since HTML uses certain characters for its syntax, we need a way to differentiate
between those characters as HTML and those same characters as content
Specifically, there are three characters that should always be escaped to make
sure they don't cause rendering issues: > < &
you should use the HTML entity (&lt; &gt; &amp;)
&copy; &quote;
&nbsp; NB: NON usarlo per mettere più spazi! -> fare uno span e stilizzarlo usando i margini

09 Creating Links
tag a attr href
Links pretty much what makes the web what it is
- internal links
- external links usually starts with http:// e legato a _blank
It's also a very good idea to always specify a title attribute for the a tag.
The title attribute is used by the screen readers
that help the visually impaired people get through the web page
Another type of link that is extremely important to know about is a fragment identifier
It's a # followed by some name (fa riferimento a id="nome")
While fragment identifiers are very useful in order to jump to different parts of
the same page, recently they have become even more important as they're used for
navigation within the SPA or Single Page Applications.

10 Displaying Images
img /src it's a really good idea to always specify the width and the height
img tag is an inline element
And if this images take time to load, the page might appear jumpy.
So this is actually the primary reason why you would want to use the width and
the height of the image
You want to tell the browser to reserve this space and
to visually partition your page such that it knows that there should be something
going on in there even if it takes time to load it
And remember to always specify width and height of the image tag whenever possible,
because without it, it may break your layouts. 

11 Power of CSS
You need to style your content in a way that's pleasing and useful to the user.
The use of color, positioning, size, among other things, is all part of that.
Cascading style sheets, or CSS,
is the technology that provides the styling capability
csszengarden.com

12 Anatomy of a CSS Rule
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements.
These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed
A CSS rule consists of selector. The selector is followed by open and close curly braces. Inside of those braces, we have CSS declaration.
And it consist of two parts, the property and the value
Now, the collection of these CSS rules is what's called a style sheet
Now, in later lecture we'll talk about where CSS styles should really go for
a real world website.
But for now, for convenience sake, we'll just put it straight in the head part of the document
Every browser comes with some default styles that it applies to different HTML
elements

13 Element, Class, and ID Selectors
CSS selectors are used to determine which HTML element, or set of elements,
to apply the CSS declarations to.
The browser uses its selector API to traverse the DOM or
Document Object Model, and pick out the elements matching the selector.
Now crafting a selector is a great skill to have and not only for
styling using CSS.
That's because a lot of JavaScript libraries out there
use the browser selector API to attach behavior and data to HTML elements
In this lecture, we're going to talk about three different types of selectors,
element, class, and id selector.
the element selector is just you specifying the element name
the class selector is specified with a dot and the name of the class
The class selector does require a little bit of a change to your HTML document
in that each element that you want that class applied to
has to have a attribute class equal to the class name
Note the differences between the way you define a class and
then the way you use the class.
You define the class always with a dot in front of a name.
There cannot be any space between the dot and
the name of the class in case no space between the dot and the word blue.
However, when you use the class, you don't use the dot in its name,
you just use its name
The way you specify an id selector is by specifying the value of an id
of an element within your HTML document, preceded by a pound sign.
So the name is a value of some id within our HTML document
the id selector is defined with a pound sign followed
by the value of an id within your HTML document.
And again, you can not have any space between the two.
But when you use it the pound goes away,
it's just the actual value of the id itself
Now in order to write more efficient rules,
CSS allows us to group several selectors into one CSS rule (con la virgola)

14 Combining Selectors
Combining Selectors is a very powerful technique that allows you to more
precisely target dumb elements
element with class selector (p.classe)
child selector (elPadre > elFiglio - si legge da dx a sx: seleziona tutti gli elementi del tipo specificato che sono figli diretti di un padre)
descendant selector (elPadre elSotto - si legge da dx a sx: seleziona tutti gli elementi del tipo specificato che sono discendenti di un padre)
the way you apply multiple classes to an element
is just by listing them in the class attribute with a space between them
So the way we could specify that, it's just to say, .highlight.mainpoint,
that is to say that an element that has highlight class and also has
a mainpoint class assigned to it should be  formattato secondo la regola ...

15 Pseudo-Class Selectors
Pseudo-class selectors address targeting only the structures that can be targeted by simple combinations of regular selectors, or
targeting the ability to style based on user interaction with the page.
For example, we would want the styling of an element to change if the user hovers or moves their mouse over that element
The way you specify pseudo-class selector, is by specifying some selector
that we all ready know about with a colon and a predefined pseudo-class name
In this lecture we're going to cover five of them.
The first four link, visited, hover, and
active are pretty basic and is used very, very often.
The last pseudo-class will cover nth-child is a fairly powerful pseudo-class and
can get pretty complicated, but
its basic uses are fairly straight forward
And the first thing I'd like to do is I'd like to style this unordered list
as a menu.
It's a pretty common practice to take an unordered list and style it as a menu
The first thing we want to do is target these list items.
So the way we're going to do this is by using our descendant selector by saying
header li, and we'll turn off the bullet points by saying list-style: none
The next task is to style the links that are sitting inside the li elements and
to make them look like buttons.
However styling links is not exactly as straight forward as styling a regular
element, and that's because links have states.
And these states can be expressed using our pseudo-classes
So here we're targeting two states.
One is a's being a link that it is.
And another one a visited
we want them (i tag a) to block level element
and give it a width of 200 pixels (e funziona perghé sono block el.)
However we're not done because what we would like to do is
on the user hovering over these buttons, besides changing the cursor to a pointer,
I'd like to have some sort of interaction in the style and
kind of show the user that they're hovering over these buttons.
So in order to do that I have to define two more states of the link.
One is a hover and the other a active. 
hover is exactly what it sounds
An active is that state when the user actually clicks on the element but
hasn't yet released his click
In it's simplest form, the nth child pseudo-selector allows you to
target a particular element within a list.
For example I'd like to target this Facebook fan page link

16 Style Placement
Your choice for placing styles in one versus another place doesn't only affect
how reusable the styles are, but
it also affects which style declarations override other style declarations
we've been specifying all of our styles
inside the style tag that sits inside of the head tag of our HTML document. 
you could specify a CSS style directly on the element by providing
the style attribute
This is called inline styling, and as you might have guessed,
this is the least reusable way of styling elements there is
For that reason, this is the least preferred method of styling, and
you should really try to stay as far away from this as possible
However, what happens if I have multiple pages in my website and
I want them to look consistent?
Which means specifying the styles inside the head tag over one particular HTML page
is really not going to help me with the others.
That means I really need some sort of other way to specify styles that
are external to the HTML page and kind of link them back in into my HTML page
Well, this is what external style sheets are all about.
And you can see that we're specifying one here with a tag called link,
and we're telling the browser that it's the style sheet and
its location using the familiar href attribute
External style sheets are just styles with lists of CSS rules.
 in a real-world website,
you almost always want all your styles to be external to your HTML page. 
If you're trying to overwrite styles that are external to your HTML page and
you have no control over, it's better to create your own external CSS file, and
then specify it below the external CSS file that you have no control over. 

17 Conflict Resolution
Cascading is a fundamental feature of CSS.
It's an algorithm defining how to combine properties values originating from
different sources.
Origin: the last declaration wins
The next concept we're going to take a look at is inheritance.
And it's a pretty simple concept.
The basic idea is that you have the document object model tree.
And if you specify some CSS property on some element, all the children and
grandchildren and so on and so on of that element will also inherit that
property without you having to specify the property for each and every element
it happens to be a very powerful technique as well.
It allows me to specify one rule and
have all the children of the target element inherit that rule. 
It's a very common practice to specify some declarations for the body tag and
the reason is obvious.
Body is the top element in our HTML as far as the view port is concerned. 
Next, let's talk about the concept of specificity.
most specific selector combination wins.
You can think of specificity of your selectors as keeping a score.
The selectors with the highest score win. 
The most specific targeting that exists in CSS doesn't
actually use any selectors at all and that is the style attribute on an element
Next is specificity value, comes the ID, then the class or pseudo-class, and
then the number of elements that are used in your selected combination. 
There's one more concept that I'd like to show you.
And that is a concept of overriding all these rules taken all together with
the !important. 
So avoid using important unless you absolutely have to

18 Styling Text
font-family
So what you usually put in the font-family is the value is combinations of fonts.
And the reason you put not just one font, but a few fonts is because
when you specify font-family in this way, you're relying on the client's computer,
you're relying on the user's computer to have that font installed.
And it's possible that a particular font will not be installed on the user's
computer, so you want to provide some options, and at the very least, you want
to provide whether you want a serif type of font, or sans-serif type of font. 
color
font-style
font-weight
font size
Now don't confuse this with points, these are pixels.
Points are used in print when you do Microsoft Word or something like that, but
not on screen. On screen you use pixels.
Pixels are what's considered absolute unit of measurement for size.
However, they do have a bit of a relative component to them.
Pixels are relative to the viewing device.
For low DPI or low dots per inch devices, one pixel is one device pixel dot of the display.
For printers and high-resolution screens, one pixel implies multiple device pixels.
Point is, higher DPI devices will give you sharper text, because for every
pixel that it's drawing, it's actually drawing multiple pixels on the device.
With all that said, pixels is still considered an absolute unit of measurement. 
text-transform
text-align
Okay let's talk a little bit about relative font sizing.
Now there are two units of measurements that are relative that we're going
to talk about and that is percent and ems. 
Let's start with percent first of all let's specify that our body tag
should have fun size of a 120 %.
And what that means is Is that we want to take whatever the default size is,
and by default I mean whatever the browser provides by default, and
increase it by 120%.
You can actually do a quick calculation and
figure out what pixel size that would be.
Most browsers have 16 pixels as default text size.
So 120% of 16 would a little bit over 19 pixels. 
em is a unit of measurement that is equivalent to the width of the letter
m in this particular font that we're using. 
When you specify them on subsequent elements,
they don't have an overriding effect, they have a cumulative effect instead. 
First it's a pretty common practice, that if you want to increase the font-size in the entire document, that you specify percentage and
you apply it usually to the most parent tag, which is usually the body tag.
And technically speaking, you could have continued to use percentages even here.
So 2em really translates to 200%.
However it's more common to use ems when you're talking about relative sizes
within the documents itself. 
I highly recommend you don't mix and match the percentage, ems and
certainly not the absolute value units all over the place. 

19 The Box Model
In HTML every element is considered a box.
Besides their content, each box consists of padding, border as well as margins.
The box model refers to the components that make up an HTML box
as well as the rules that govern how these box components affect the layout
as well as how width and height of the box are calculated.
padding, margin, border
background-color
width, height
width è del contenuto; la larghezza del box è width + padding + border
(box model W3C)
in CSS3 c'è la proprietà box-sizing che, se impostata a border-box fa si che la larghezza totale del box sia quella specificata in width (come succedeva nel box-model di MS!!!)
But the truth of the matter is, all the modern frameworks like Bootstrap and
others use box, border box as its sizing mode,
and as you plan and work with your layouts this is the same choice to make.
So, make sure you always stay with a box sizing of border box.
NB: ma box-sizing NON viene ereditata!
-> per avere box-sizing: border-box in tutto il documento usiamo il selettore *:
* {box-sizing: border-box;}
Ma box-sizing si può usare in tutti i browser?
Per vedere questo usare il sito www.caniuse.com
margins that are left to right are cumulative
in verticale the margins collapse, and the larger margin wins
if you wanted to reset the CSS browser defaults
if you would do this most of the time using the star selector
Se fissiamo un'altezza troppo piccola il contenuto deborda. come si gestisce? Con	
overflow
Con overflow: auto compare, se serve, la barra di scorrimento.
Per averla sempre visibile, impostare overflow: scroll

20 The background Property
background-color
background-image (the URL that you supply is a relative variable, but
it has to be relative to your CSS)
background-repeat
Also notice that we're using a background-color property and
a background-image property at the same time.
And you can see that image wins on terms of priority.
It is on top of the color.
background-position (specify the position of the image within the element. Now, specifying only one of these will make the other one default to center)

21 Positioning Elements by Floating
When you float elements, the browser takes them out of the regular document flow
when it comes to floated elements, the margins never collapse.
the browser should resume the regular document flow.
And the way that we do that is by using the clear property.
So let's go ahead and go to our styling and define section target and
wel say, clear: left.
And what this is doing is telling the browser that the section element is
announcing that nothing should be allowed to be floating to the left of it. 
(la section è quella nel codice di esempio)
clear: left,
so nothing should be allowed to flow to the left of it
Okay, so let's go ahead and try to achieve that two column layout design. 
Floats are taken out of their normal document flow, and
they're positioned at the top left or right edge of the containing element.
Also, floats don't have vertical margin collapse, so
previously hidden or collapsed margins will show up once you float the element.
And remember that to resume normal document flow, use the clear property.

22 Relative and Absolute Element Positioning (+ Static)
Static positioning is basically a different way of saying normal
document flow.
It is actually a default setting for all elements, except html.
And if you try to apply positioning offsets on elements
who's position property is set to static, the offsets are just ignored. 
Let's speak about a couple more positioning schemes: relative and absolute.
These positioning schemes allow you to specify precise offsets to move
the target element to the different part of the page origin. 
When you apply position relative on an element.
the element is positioned relative to its position in the normal document flow.
In other words, if you were to apply offsets on that element, there will be
offset, from the original normal document flow position of that element. 
The positioning CSS offset properties are top, bottom, left, and right.
So when you position element as relative you're basically creating like an anchor
for the offsets.
So the elements top, bottom, left, and right edges become the boundaries from which you offset the element. 
The important thing to know about relative position is that the element
that is set to relative positioning is not taken out of normal document flow.
In fact even if it's moved by using the offsets, its original spot is preserved.
In sostanza, l'elemento viene visualizzato spostato, ma viene "percepito" dagli altri elementi come se fosse nella sua posizione normale. 
So the way you could think about these offsets is really not top or
left but more like from the top and from left. 
So if you take from left 50 pixels, you move 50 pixels to the right, and
if you take from top 50 pixels, you're really removing 50 pixels from the top. 
The original space for that element still remains and the originally laid out
elements around that element still remain exactly the same,
because they think the element is still sitting in its original spot. 
Now the idea of absolute positioning is that all offsets, top, bottom, left,
right, are all relative to the position of the nearest ancestor
which has positioning set on it other than static.
In other words, some parent, grandparent, on and on and
on, ancestor has to have its positioning set other than static, and
then the absolute positioning will actually start working.
By default, HTML element is the only element that has non-static positioning set on it. And it's actually set to relative.
Unlike relative positioning, the element is taken out
out of its normal document flow if it's positioning a set to absolute. 
Gli offset di un elemento con posizionamento absolute sono relativi all'antenato più vicino (es. il padre) che abbia posizionamento diverso da static.

23 Media Queries
Media queries allow you to group styles together and target them to devices based on some criteria.
For example, you can target a device by its width, its height, or orientation.
Of course one of the most obvious differences between viewing
a website on a desktop browser and your cell phone is the screen size.
Remember that using CSS you have the power to produce very different web page layouts from the same HTML. 
Without media queries, responsive design wouldn't be possible. 
A media query starts with a keyword @media, and
then it is followed by a media feature, and followed by curly braces.
Within those curly braces you have your styles.
Each media feature resolves to either true or false.
You can have more than one media features combine together using logical operators.
If the media features resolve to true, the style within the curly braces apply. 
There are quite a bit of these media features that are available.
So you can have max-width, you can have min-width, you can have height which is
not listed here, you can even target orientation of your device, portrait or
landscape, you can target only screens as opposed to targeting only print.
the most common ones are the max-width and the min-width.

the media features can be combined using logical operators.
One of the most common logical operators is the and operator.
Another way to combine media features is to place comma in between them which will basically translate into being equivalent to an OR operator.
when you approach responsive design and
responsive layouts, the most common logical operator is the and operator. 
Now before we jump into a code example I'd like to show you a very common approach
how you structure media queries within your style sheet.
What usually happens is you have a few of these media queries, but
you almost always start with some base styles.
Base styles will apply across the board no matter what screen size
you actually are viewing the website on.
Then you go ahead and start targeting a particular screen size
by either changing some of the properties of the base styles or
adding something else to them or maybe taking something away. 

24 Responsive Design
Responsive design was born primarily out of the need to deal
with the explosion of mobile devices that started being able to
browse the web much in the same way that a desktop browser user browsed the web. 
Gli smartphone hanno schermi più piccoli, e quindi bisogna adattare il sito alle varie dimensioni degli schermi.
So what is a responsive web site?
Well, that's a site that's designed to adapt its layout to the viewing
environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids,
flexible images, and CSS3 media queries.
And by proportion-based grids, what we mean is or
hinting to Is that the width of these grids or
these columns as we'll see in a moment should be specified using a percentage. 
The largest part of responsive design is, obviously, the layout.
And the most common layout out there or responsive layout, is a 12-column grid
responsive layout and this is what, a bootstrap, Twitter Bootstrap uses and
just about almost really every responsive framework out there uses nowadays.
And, the reason 12 is what's used is because of the factors of 12.
You could basically, t's evenly, nicely divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and
obviously 12 itself, which means, we could sub-divide our
page into sections that are evenly split and nicely layout themselves.
Impostazione "manuale" di una pagina con responsive design
- si informa il browser dei telefonini di non zoomare (il nostro sito ha un responsive design, e quindi non deve essere zoomato - verrebbe rimpicciolito):
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
- tutte le larghezze devono essere date in percentuale, per adattarsi alla larghezza della finestra
- si dichiara la "riga" che conterrà gli elementi del nostro responsive design:
  width: 100% (la riga occupa tutto lo spazio del suo contenitore)
- tramite le media query (una per ogni tipo di larghezza che vogliamo gestire) si definiscono le caratteristiche delle colonne lungo le quali si disporranno gli elementi del layout:
  - nomi del tipo col-lg... e col-md... 
    (no small, perché è il default)
  - float: left; width: ...;
- struttura html_
  - <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg... col-md...> ... </div>
	  per varie volte (per via delle media query SOLO  UNA delle classi esisterà - e quindi sarà applicata - in funzione delle caratteristiche del device nel quale viene visualizzata la pagina)
	  Poiché le classi "col---" sono float, a seconda delle loro larghezze si disporranno in fila nella riga per un certo numero di colonne, e poi andranno a capo. Poiché la loro larghezza dipenda dalle media query, il numero di box in riga varierà a seconda dell'effettiva dimensione della finestra del browser. Quando lo schermo è piccolo (la nostra condizione di default) non abbiamo messo media query (quindi classi tipo col-lg e col-md NON esistono) i nostri div non saranno più float, e poiché sono elementi di blocco si impileranno automaticamente uno sotto l'altro (e quindi avrò un layout a 1 colonna).

25 Introduction to Twitter Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a CSS framework.
Bootstrap è basato su jQuery.
Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for
developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. 
Bootstrap consists mostly of CSS.
It pre-defines a lot of CSS classes for you. 
Bootstrap grid system (totale larghezze delle colonne = 12)-
The concept of Mobile First, that is, the importance of
planning for the mobile version of your website from the very beginning. 
Per usare Bootstrap conviene preparare un modello di pagina html5 con il meta "viewport" e i riferimenti per includere (da locale o da cdn) i file bootstrap.min.css, e nell'ordine jquery.min.js, popper.min.js e bootstrap.min.js.
Le media query sono già implementate in bootstrap.min.css

26 The Bootstrap Grid System
one of the most central components of Bootstrap that allows developers to easily
create responsive layouts is the grid system. 
First of all, your Bootstrap grid always has to be inside of a container wrapper.
The next component of the grid is the row.
So the row class creates horizontal groups of columns
which means that the columns collapse and interact with each other as a group but
independently from columns in another row. 
Let's move on to the columns.
So every Bootstrap column class is defined using this template.
It's c o l, col, for column dash SIZE and then dash SPAN.
And let's go over the components of this, of the two components of this template.
First of all the size.
Well the size is screen width range identifier and
it's something like MD for medium, LG for large, and so on.
And the span, is really, all it is is how many columns the element should span.
So the values are from 1 to 12.
And I've mentioned many times that Bootstrap is a 12 column grid layout. 
Nel body il div principale è <div class="container-fluid"> (oppure "container")
Nelle varie "row" mettere gli schemi delle colonne in modo che, per ogni classe grid considerata (tra xs, sm, md, lg) il totale delle "larghezze" faccia 12. Ad es:
<div class="col-sm-3 col-md-6 col-lg-4">bla bla</div>
<div class="col-sm-9 col-md-6 col-lg-8">bla bla bla</div>
(sm-3 + sm-9 = 12;   md-6 + md-6 = 12)
Gli elementi che costituiscono le colonne del responsive design devono avere classi multiple che vengono attivate in modo mutuamente esclusivo tramite media query che tengono conto delle caratteristiche (es tipo, larghezza) del dispositivo o del(la finestra del) browser nel quale viene visualizzata la pagina.
Info molto buone sui breakpoint e in generale sul "grid system" di Bootstrap in https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/
o in https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/
Which means that if you want to guarantee that there is always going to be
a particular layout, you could just specify it in the col-xs and it will stay.
No matter what the size of the screen, that's the layout that will stay. 

27: Visit with the Client
Now before we go and visit with the client, let's go over some rules and
just basic ideas, so you're not completely in the dark.
Now obviously, this is not going to be a comprehensive business strategies or
comprehensive how to deal with clients, but some basic ground rules just so
we understand where we're coming from.
And the first concept that you need to remember is that most clients have
no idea what they want.
So, it's really your job to ask questions.
And most importantly, the right questions to help the client figure
out what it is that they want and kind of communicate that back to you. 
A great way of doing it is if you bring some website examples of similar
businesses that already have websites and have the client react to those websites. 
Now as a general rule,
every single client is going to want to put a lot of information on the page.
The only problem is, is that when everything is important,
nothing is really important.
So again,
it's your job really to encourage the client to follow a very simple rule.
Less is more.
The less information you put up, the more impact that information will get. 
you should try to help the client do is identify the crucial
information,
Now, a quick tip I'd love to share with you is the fact that you
should always try to find a way for the client to invest in the project and this
is especially true if you're doing this for free just to build up your portfolio.
The client needs to feel like they have some skin in the game, as well.
If they don't, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be some
side project that they're really not going to pay much attention to and
you're going to spend and invest all this time of your own and
not necessarily get much cooperation from their side. 
Another important rule is make sure that you have the client designate one person
responsible for decisions.
If you don't, what's going to happen is that this person is going to tell you,
really what we want is this way and the other person in the business is going
to tell you we want something else differently here.
If you have one person, you could always tell the other people that are suggesting
things that it's a great suggestion and I am responsible to this particular
one person and I'll bring that suggestion to that person. 
Limit the number of revisions UPFRONT.
Make sure you communicate to the client upfront, have them even sign a contract,
have them sign that this is the number of revisions that I'm willing to make.
Because obviously, the clients can go on forever and
ever and ever and your time is limited. Now if it's a paying job, don't limit revisions out of hand,
but limit the number of free revisions.
If you say, I will revise the site within reason not completely turn it upside down.
But within reason, I'll revise it up to like three times free. 
I highly suggest you Google web development client questionnaire and
you will see a whole bunch of resources that you can draw from to really find out
how to ask these questions and what kind of answers to look for
Another quick tip I'd like to share with you is you should try to involve others if
you need it.
So for example, if you're not a super duper graphic designer and
we're really concentrating on coding things not really designing per se,
you could contact the local college and see if a graphic designer student wants to
join you and provide some free design services and put that on their resume. 
I will still have the restaurant owner invest in this project.
And the way they will invest is that they agree to provide every single item on
the menu to provide for us just, so we could take proper pictures of those items. 
So it's hours and hours of their work, but it's something that shows the client
is involved and the client is committed and that's very important. 
Now, another thing is definitely don't go in to the meeting with the client without
first finding out what does the client have right now.
What kind of website do we have they have?
What information is being displayed?
Just to learn a little bit about the business. 

When you get right down to it, this really is all about setting expectations.
Whether it's expectations about what the client is expecting from us or
our expectations of what the client is going to provide.
So, if we can achieve that of communicating those expectations very
clearly, we've done our job. 
Basically, we're going to create a mockup of the website, not the real website.
So just a mock-up, a drawing of the website.
And we're going to show it to you and
basically see if you approve of the way it's going.
And we'll give you three revisions, three times
that you can update the thing and say, I want something different a little bit.
And after that, you'll try to finalize it.
Are you okay with that? 
So pictures that have usually, especially, a website like this is very important. 

28 Design Overview
So when you're first starting to design a website,
the worst thing you could possibly do is start coding right away.
You don't want to do that.
You don't want to design a website coding it at the same time.
What you do want to do is you want to have some mock ups, some layout mock ups,
that you present to the client that take little to no time to design and
to put together and present to the client.
So what we're going to do is design the mock ups first.
So the tool we're going to use is called balsamiq.com
This tool is not free
Now, this big area, what's planned for
this is some kind of a picture of the inside of the restaurant.
It's going to be what's called a jumbotron In Bootstrap. 
Next, let's take a look at some design that has already some colors and
some more concrete layout.
So here's what our designer came up with.
This is just a basic idea,
this is what you are usually going to get back from a designer.
You're going to get some kind of a color scheme.
Some photography.
And the photography is not from this particular restaurant.
It's just some stock photography that you can certainly use
in order to kind of enhance the site to see what it looks like. 
Designer will typically provide for you the hexodus more color values for
different components within your website, and
it will also tell you which fonts that they used inside this design.
Now depending on your budget and if you're trying to do things for free or
certainly trying to find free resources,
I'll recommend the prompt that you try to stick with Google fonts.
There's a website Google.com/fonts. 

29 Some Ground Rules and Overview of Setup
So the first thing we want to do here is set up some global styles that the entire page, and really, across all pages, will be true.
So we'll do that using body. 
Google fonts: https://www.google.com/fonts
Fare click sul font desiderato (lo si può anche cercare per nome) e nella pagina successiva fare click su "+ Select this style"
Appare a dx una finestra, nella quale si può copiare il codice da inserire nel file html per usare il font (NB: se si chiude la finestra, per tiaprirla fare click sul pulsantino con i 3 quadrati e il più, dopo "Download Family").

30 Coding Basics of Navbar Header
there is a semantic HTML5 tag called header.
So the first thing that we're going to do is create our nav bar.
Basically, the navigation bar.
And this is going to be done by the nav element, and
we're going to give it an ID called header nav.
And we'll see in a minute why we're going to need that.
And we're going to give it some classes that Bootstrap provides for us.
And it's going to be two classes.
One is navbar.
Another one is navbar default. 
Now Bootstrap does this a lot.
It will give you like a base class, and it will give you then a sub
class that basically uses the base class, plus add something to it.
So there's navbar default, there's navbar invert.
There's different classes that really share some of the properties of
the navbar, so you should really just get used to that
and
remember there's two types of containers.
There's a container dash fluid, and
that's the one that stretches all the way to the edges of the browser.
And it has a bit of a padding on both sides,
about 15 pixels of padding on both sides.
And then there's the regular container that actually changes its width
based on the width of the browser.
And basically our entire content of our website is going to sit inside of that
container or at least be aligned with this container.
This is going to be our header container, and
we're going to have another one that's going to be for the main content.
And the reason we're doing this instead of using container fluid
is because our website doesn't have that much information on it.
If it doesn't so many different things going on here.
So if we were to let the content stretch and
reposition itself all the way to the widest point,
the width of the browser, this website would look a little bit weird.
go ahead and
try to place our logo in the top left of that header element.
it has a class called navbar header.
And basically if you look up the Bootstrap documentation,
it's kind of a wrapper class that a lot of
other classes will depend on being in this position in order to work properly. 
So how did I know to put navbar header here and wrap some items in it?
Well the way I knew it is to go to documentation. 
logo-img è un div (e non una img) perché l'immagine la mettiamo come background via css.
And the way you do it in a boot strap is you apply.
In this case to this region right here which is our logo, and
we'll apply a class called pull-left.
And pull-left is basically float left. NB: in Bootstrap 5 la classe è float-start!
we don't always want to display this logo as we squeeze
the browser
Okay so if we go to index.html there are a couple of classes that bootstrap defines
that let's you basically say that this element should only be visible in
a particular break point and they're called visible, visible-md and
what I'm saying is if the screen size is medium I want this element,
this a href element to be visible but if it's anything other than,
at this point, a medium-sized screen, I don't want this element to be displayed. 
NB: in Bootstrap 5 visible-md diventa d-none d-lg-block

32 Coding Nav Menu Buttons
il riferimento della classe data-bs-target del button indica al plugin js qual è l'area da collassare.
Il menu è una ul. And we're going to give it a few classes.
One is nav, navbar-nav, and navbar-right (in BS 5 navbar-right -> navbar-end).
Well nav and navbar-nav is basically saying that
I am going to be a component of our navigation bar or navigation. 
So this is navbar-right means I want to still have a navigation bar, but
I want it to be pulled to right. I want it to float all the way to the right.
Le voci del nemu sono tag li con dentro tag a.

a special couple of classes: Glyphicon, glyphicon-cutlery.
And what these classes do is they're able to bring in what's called an icon font.
An icon font is basically a vector based image that is able to
behave in the same way that that the font would behave.
In other words you could size it, you could colorize it, give it a color,

NB: le icone Glyphicon NON SONO PIU' DISPONOBILI dalla vers. 4 di Bootstrap!
Usare le icone sviluppate da Bootstrap:
https://icons.getbootstrap.com/

Altre possibilità:
Font Awesome: https://fontawesome.com/

Also notice, we're putting a break between the actual icon and the word menu.
But we're not just putting a break, we're putting a class on it and
we're saying hidden-xs (in BS 5 è d-none d-sm-block) which means I want this break to go away when the screen size is extra small.
And there are a couple of things here.
Number one is I'm telling you tel with a colon and the phone number and
what's that going to do is if actually somebody clicks on it or taps on it
they will trigger the phone to try to call it, so let's say you have calling
program installed on your computer in the regular desktop, they'll trigger that.
Or if you're on a mobile phone, this type of set-up will trigger the phone to try to call or use its phone feature to call:
href="tel:410-602-5008" -> lo smartphone chiama il numero.
 
33 Fixing Navbar Layout, Text, and Dropdown Menus
And the font size is something we haven't really seen in this type of unit before. It's 5vw.
What is vw stand for?
Well vw stands for viewport width and one unit, so
if you let me create a little note here as one unit of vw,
vw is equals to 1% of viewport Width. 
And the reason we're using these units is because these units are responsive.
In other words as the screen keeps stretching and being squeezed
this is going to be, the font size is going to be relative to the screen width. 

Lecture 34 Coding the Jumbotron
And what we're going to start with is this giant picture of the restaurant,
of the interior of the restaurant, which is actually what's called the Jumbotron in bootstrap speak.
However before we start, we're going to have to define some element that is going
to be a container for everything that is inside of our website.
And that's simply because remember, we put in the container our header and
we want everything nicely aligned to its edges.
So we need a top level element within our main content
to have a container class assigned to it.
Well the way we're going to code our Jumbotron is we have a whole bunch of
images in the Images folder.
As you can see, jumbotron, they all are sized very differently.
The first one is 768, that one is 768 pixels wide.
Then there's jumbotron 992.
That one is 992 pixels wide, and finally the 1200 one is the biggest one there.
And obviously what we want from this is, to be able to substitute different
pictures, different resolutions, depending on the screen size. 
And what's going to happen is we're going to assign a background CSS property
to this DIV and it's going to load the image responsively.
Meaning depending on the media query it's going to appear and
is going to load different size image.
The classes, the class IMG responsive comes from Bootstrap.
And basically what it says is, as I change the width of the browser, the width and the sizing of the image is going to change proportionally. 
And also I'm only going to make this visible when the screen is extra small.
Okay so let's go back to our code editor and we'll open up our styles.css file and we'll load our jumbotron images in this proper media query.
And we're setting it's height because as you know background images don't effect
the height of the element, so therefore we need to set the height.
